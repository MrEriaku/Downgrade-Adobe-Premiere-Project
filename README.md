Premiere Pro Downgrader

Welcome to the Premiere Pro Downgrader GitHub repository! This tool is designed to help users downgrade their Adobe Premiere Pro projects with ease, allowing them to work with older versions of the software.

Features:

    - Easy-to-use web page interface
    - Clear and concise instructions
    - Compatible with GitHub repository

Limitations:

It is important to note that the downgrading process is not perfect, and there are some limitations to what can be achieved. Specifically, edits made using the new Type Tool will be lost as CC 2017 and older versions do not support this feature.

Additionally, while the downgrading process is designed to be as smooth and seamless as possible, we cannot guarantee that the project will work perfectly in an older version of Premiere Pro. We recommend testing the project thoroughly after downgrading to ensure that everything is functioning as intended.
Installation

To use the Premiere Pro Downgrader, simply download the zip file containing the web page and follow the instructions provided on the interface. The zip file can be found in the "Releases" section of this repository.
